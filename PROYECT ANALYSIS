NAOMI (F)

Observations:

* Consistent attendance.
* Lifts moderate weights across various exercises.
* Focuses on both upper and lower body, but some exercises could be diversified.

Recommendations:

* Introduce more variety in exercises to target different parts of each muscle group.
* Gradually increase weight for progressive overload.
* Maintain consistency to improve overall strength and endurance.

MONICA (F)

Observations:
* Moderate attendance.
* Uses lighter weights compared to peers.
* Limited focus on leg exercises.

Recommendations:

* Increase participation in workouts for better consistency.
* Gradually increase weights, especially in leg exercises.
* Include more compound exercises to strengthen multiple muscle groups simultaneously.

ERIC (M)

Observations:

* Strong in upper body exercises; lifts heavier weights for chest and back.
* Could improve lower body training.

Recommendations:

* Balance workouts with more leg-focused exercises to avoid upper-body dominance.
* Keep track of repetitions and progressively increase weights to continue gains.
* Maintain consistent attendance for better overall results.

IRINA (F)

Observations:

* Consistent but uses light to moderate weights.
* Focuses primarily on upper body exercises.

Recommendations:

* Increase lower body training to balance overall development.
* Gradually increase weight on exercises to promote strength gains.
* Add variety in exercises to target different parts of each muscle group.

JIMENA (F)

Observations:

* Least consistent in attendance.
* Lifts heavy weights, especially in leg exercises.
* Upper body strength less developed compared to lower body.

Recommendations:

* Improve consistency to maintain progress across all muscle groups.
* Balance training between upper and lower body.
* Continue lifting heavy safely but diversify exercises to avoid overloading only legs.

HUGO (M)

Observations:

* Repeats the same exercises frequently.
* Strength is concentrated in a few muscle areas.
* Attendance is moderate.

Recommendations:

* Introduce variety in exercises to target all parts of each muscle group.
* Avoid focusing too much on one area to prevent imbalances.

Increase consistency in workouts for overall strength improvement.
